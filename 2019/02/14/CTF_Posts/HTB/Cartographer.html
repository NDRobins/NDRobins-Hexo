<h2 id="tags"><a href="#tags" class="headerlink" title="tags:"></a>tags:</h2><p>I took on cartographer right after completing lernaean so I had the same process in my mind.<br>I captured a sample packet, formed a hydra command and set it loose. The trouble with that is that it was the wrong way to solve it and there was no failure flag for hydra to use. So after realising that I was going to get nowhere like that I investigated how the website worked. I found out that the login form was weak to sql injection so I put in an always true statement and was presented a page saying that cartographer was still in construction.<br>From here I noticed that the url had a query after it: ?info=home.<br>Going out on a limb i changed the home to flag and was given the flag i was after.<br>{% asset_img flag.png flag %}</p>
