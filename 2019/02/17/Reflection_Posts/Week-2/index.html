<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>This week has been a rollercoaster of good and bad experiences. Due to a bit of a family crisis, my schedule and priorities got somewhat messed up. As a result I fell behind in some tasks and got confused with others. Redesigning my site took the biggest hit as I intended to get it up on Friday and wasnt able to get it together enough to deploy again until Sunday. With the coming week I plan to schedule my time and sequence my tasks better to avoid this mixup again.</p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>After being told about Hexo, the utter catastrophe that was my last site was retired and replaced with this. The static site generating tool was incredibly easy to set up, with the only real issue being the choice of theme. Migrating the posts wasnt too much of an issue as I could move the plain text to a new post (which is why the dates on all of my posts are wrong). Modifying the theme to make it more personal and removing the chinese widgets was an interesting experience. I found myself looking through each file and developing an understanding of how the site was assembled by hexo.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Throughout the week, I dedicated myself to learning web vulnerabilities and exploits. I completed several web based CTFâ€™s including many from PicoCTF and all but one of the web challenges from Hack The Box. For some of these challenges I was able to apply my previous knowledge of topics such as sql injection, but more often than not I found myself back opening new tabs to look up something new (had upward of 40 tabs at one point). </p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>On more than one occasion I found myself consulting my team mates to solve a challenge. For the Lernaean HTB challenge, I had tried it before several years prior and got stumped on a certain part of it; However during the Wednesday class, I worked with David on solving the issue and was able to beat it quite quickly. Several days later, I was attempting the HTB IKnowMag1k challenge and had hit another wall. When I challenged David to see if he could beat it he hit the same wall that I did. We got into a voice chat banging our heads against the aforementioned wall until we finally worked it out at 3am. The ordeal was stressful and exhausting but informative and in the end quite fun.</p>
<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>This last week was quite fun as I was able to learn the practical side of cyber security. We were given an informative presentation from Luke and researched bug bounties and ethical hacking. Solving the CTF challenges was quite entertaining and showed me just how much I have yet to learn and the capabilities of web based attacks.</p>
