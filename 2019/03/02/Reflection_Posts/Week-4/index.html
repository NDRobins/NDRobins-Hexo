<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>This last week has gone by in a bit of a blur. Either its because I was sleep deprived for the majority of it or because it was so enjoyable. Im both exhausted and content with my progress.<br>This last week started with an industry professional leading us through a seminar on reverse engineering. He gave us basic challenges to solve using binary ninja that functioned like a CTF with a flag hidden somewhere in the file. </p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>Throughout the week I was faced with many different challenges that required me to change my way of thinking about challenges. The Hack The Box machines have a lot of rabbitholes that require a lot of time to be sunk in determining whether it is relevant to the challenge or not. Learning new methods of enumeration and different things to be keeping my eyes out for is greatly improving my ability to break through the challenges.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Throughout this week I applied myslef to more Hack The Box machines, including access where I reached user (machine was too slow to go for root) and got the root flag from curling. In the coming weeks where the pressure is pretty much gone, I will finish access and go for more machines as I really do love the experience.</p>

<p>Learning the basics of reverse engineering piqued my interest as it was one of the areas I knew the least about going into this. My original thoughts were that it would almost entirely consist of disecting code to reveal secrets or vulnerabilities. But there was a lot more revealed, and it still feels like we were just scratching the surface.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>On Friday, instead of a class we presented our journey and the progress we have made due to the summer studio. For the presentation, we decided to demonstrate the process of solving the piper Deloittes box as well as showing off the potential applications and easy use of the Beef xss framework. The presentation was meant to go all afternoon, but almost nobody showed up to listen. In the end we called it early and went to bar luca to get burgers as a celebration.</p>

<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>Now that the course is over I can look back on my highs and lows and judge my performance from them. The final week of the course proved to be the least stressful while allowing me to show my development through the different challenges offered. Compared to where I was in the first week, this one has revealed unbelieveable improvement. Going forward I canâ€™t wait to continue to develop my skills at my own pace without the pressure of deliverables.</p>
