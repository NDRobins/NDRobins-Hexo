<p>This course was everything I hoped it would be upon starting it. It has enabled me to reach a level of understanding about cyber security that I never thought I would reach. I originally signed up for the summer studio hoping to get a project with a bit of programming or networking. Unfortunately we were assigned to the high speed train project which was aimed more at engineering students than IT students.<br>Thanks to Larry and Darsh, we were able to swap over to the cyber security studio, and that is where this all began.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that more technical info is available in the weekly reflections</p>

<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>I started this studio having finished almost all of the cyber security submajor and looking back, I had just about no skills from it. This studio has put me on a path where I can see infosec as a viable career option and how much I still have to learn. The workload of this course was intense and often quite stressful, but in retrospect, the result was worth the effort. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, we were given guidance and presentations by industry professionals who volunteered their time to speak to us. We also were fortunate enough to have a great team leading this course with their own experience and skills on the topic.</p>

<p><code>picture is bigger than I thought</code></p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>Almost every challenge faced during the summer studio required me to shift my way of thinking in order to address new issues. I would often be faced with something that I had never seen before such as a hidden vulnerability or an overly specific application that I cant seem to use correctly. Google (duck duck go in truth) became my new best friend over the last 4 weeks as every challenge faced required me to find something that was always hidden deep in a singular search result on the 8th page of search results. The solutions were never straight forward or well defined which constantly required more creative thought on my part in order to use them. </p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Potentially the most important part of the course is the development of new skills. I began this studio believing that I had some decent skills in most parts of IT but soon realised that what I knew was just a page in a very large book. The course wasnt a guide on how to get from point A to point B, instead it was assisted research where the students were set goals and expected to learn fast enough to reach them. That being said, we weren’t alone in our efforts and were guided in the right direction by our tutors and given hints and lectures that helped us reach where we are in such a short space of time.</p>
<p>When I started the course the most I could confidently do was a couple of web exploits. Now I am quite confident that I can crack most easy machines and have a fair crack at the medium ones. I still am not quite confident enough to take on the harder machines as I feel like they will strain my sanity.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>The first deliverable that we were given was a group presentation on a security vulnerability just two days after the class began. The allotted time frame was quite stressing as we weren’t prepared to just jump straight in. The stress was relieved by having a group pre-built before entering the subject. The presentation didn’t go too well as we were all quite nervous presenting something we had only just learned in front of a group of strangers. As we realised then, our communication skills needed work too.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we took part in scrums and free for alls where we were put out of our comfort zone and had to talk about how we were going and our progress over the past couple of days. This helped us to get to know the other students in the course and develop our social skills. </p>
<p>We also used microsoft teams for communication and collaboration between tutors and students throughout the course. It served as an effective tool where we could vent any issues or questions to be answered.<br>Teams started out as a serious place reserved for proper questions and soon turned into a more relaxed environment as everyone got to know each other.</p>

<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>I believe that I have achieved more over these last four weeks than I expected when first going in. This studio has been an amazing experience that offers much more value than I would have gotten from the capstone project or the other studios offered. Working with Larry, Darsh, Luke and Jai has been an a pleasure as they have helped me reach goals I never thought I could achieve. Even when issues popped up that hindered my ability to get work complete, they were understanding and helpful. This studio has been a great experience that has given me skills and understanding that I will use well into the future.</p>
