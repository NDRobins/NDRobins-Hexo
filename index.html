        <p>Week 3 in review</p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/chaos.png" title="chaos">
<p>This last week has had its fair share of challenges and problems while at the same time being extremely fun and informative. My personal challenge for this week was to complete a boot2root on a HackTheBox active machine as there are no hints or walkthroughs to help me get through them. The machine i went with was the HTB Chaos machine as it had been recommended to me by David who had beaten it just before. The challenge had its share of traps and rabbitholes and it seems I went down every one (details coming in the writeup).</p>

<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>The Chaos box required me to learn new ways to approach CTF challenges. Previous CTF’s left me searching for something obvious that stood out like a sore thumb (details left out due to HTB policies). Enumeration was both a blessing and a curse as the box would hide the next step quite deep but if you didnt find it you can spend hours searching like I did. The box also demanded that I develop new skills to move through it, for example I had to learn IMAP terminal commands (almost no information on the web), priv escalation of shells, moving from a docker reverse shell to a restricted bash shell and on to a full shell. </p>

<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Both the piper box which I managed to get user but not root in, and the chaos box that I barely managed to scrape through, were interesting tasks that provoked a new approach to these challenges. Through them I have developed a better sense for enumeration, google-fu skills and forcing myself to go forward even though I was ready to give up. I have learned how to get reverse shells and use priv esc to get more control on the target as well as improve the shell quality once established. Learning the IMAP terminal commands was an absolute pain as the only information easily available is found on a single unrelated page deep in the documentation.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/beef.png" title="beef">
<p>One of the deliverables due this week was a presentation on an infosec tool of our choice. For the presentation, our group selected the swiss army knife program that is Beef. We started looking into Beef on Tuesday night as we had all been busy up until that point. We initially were just looking into how the tool works and how it can be applied but that soon escalated once I began testing out Beef myself. Once I got it working the way it was intended (script embedded on a website to hook visitors), we were amazed by the amount of power that the program had over the hooked browser. </p>

<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>This week really showed me my progress and improvement over what I was going into this course.<br>I have developed a lot more skills and have become much more capable even though I fell like I have only just scratched the surface. Beating the HTB Chaos machine feels like a huge milestone as it is my first full boot2root on a serious challenge; Although only having completed one machine this week is a bit of a letdown as it feels like im falling behind. I hope that going forward I’m able to develop my skills such that I can breeze through challenges like these.</p>

        <p>Week 2 in review</p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>This week has been a rollercoaster of good and bad experiences. Due to a bit of a family crisis, my schedule and priorities got somewhat messed up. As a result I fell behind in some tasks and got confused with others. Redesigning my site took the biggest hit as I intended to get it up on Friday and wasnt able to get it together enough to deploy again until Sunday. With the coming week I plan to schedule my time and sequence my tasks better to avoid this mixup again.</p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>After being told about Hexo, the utter catastrophe that was my last site was retired and replaced with this. The static site generating tool was incredibly easy to set up, with the only real issue being the choice of theme. Migrating the posts wasnt too much of an issue as I could move the plain text to a new post (which is why the dates on all of my posts are wrong). Modifying the theme to make it more personal and removing the chinese widgets was an interesting experience. I found myself looking through each file and developing an understanding of how the site was assembled by hexo.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Throughout the week, I dedicated myself to learning web vulnerabilities and exploits. I completed several web based CTF’s including many from PicoCTF and all but one of the web challenges from Hack The Box. For some of these challenges I was able to apply my previous knowledge of topics such as sql injection, but more often than not I found myself back opening new tabs to look up something new (had upward of 40 tabs at one point). </p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>On more than one occasion I found myself consulting my team mates to solve a challenge. For the Lernaean HTB challenge, I had tried it before several years prior and got stumped on a certain part of it; However during the Wednesday class, I worked with David on solving the issue and was able to beat it quite quickly. Several days later, I was attempting the HTB IKnowMag1k challenge and had hit another wall. When I challenged David to see if he could beat it he hit the same wall that I did. We got into a voice chat banging our heads against the aforementioned wall until we finally worked it out at 3am. The ordeal was stressful and exhausting but informative and in the end quite fun.</p>
<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>This last week was quite fun as I was able to learn the practical side of cyber security. We were given an informative presentation from Luke and researched bug bounties and ethical hacking. Solving the CTF challenges was quite entertaining and showed me just how much I have yet to learn and the capabilities of web based attacks.</p>

        <p>I took on cartographer right after completing lernaean so I had the same process in my mind.<br>I captured a sample packet, formed a hydra command and set it loose. The trouble with that is that it was the wrong way to solve it and there was no failure flag for hydra to use. So after realising that I was going to get nowhere like that I investigated how the website worked. I found out that the login form was weak to sql injection so I put in an always true statement and was presented a page saying that cartographer was still in construction.<br>From here I noticed that the url had a query after it: ?info=home.<br>Going out on a limb i changed the home to flag and was given the flag i was after.<br></p>

<p>This test taught me how to use the burpsuite and hydra tools.<br>Upon loading the page im faced with a login form without a username field.<br>The challenge was to get past the login screen in order to get the flag.<br>After watching a video tutorial on how to use hydra and burpsuite (on a different ctf), I felt ready to take on Lernaean. </p>
<p>I set up burpsuite to intercept the packets and sent an incorrect password for the sample packet.<br>Then I turned off the interception and set up hydra using the following command:<br>hydra -V -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txst docker.hackthebox.eu http-post-form “/:password=^PASS^:F=Invalid password!” -s 33625</p>

<p>Hydra spat out the password shortly after that: leonardo.<br>Attempting to use it on the login page presents me with a new page stating that I was too slow.<br>I was quite confused at this stage and had to consult the internet for help. A reddit post where<br>someone was stuck on the same part. The internet was helpful without just giving away the answer completely. The suggestions hinted that we should use the repeater function of burpsuite to constantly send the login packet and that is exactly what I did. Shortly after, I get a response with the flag in it.</p>

<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2>

<p>If we view this course as a project, then the major stakeholders are myself, the tutors, the guest speakers and my group mates. Assuming the interests of the stakeholders lie in my development in subject, the issues lie with my lack of knowledge on the topic. The tasks set by Larry and Darshil involve the completion of ctf’s, the development of this static site, and the detailing of the process in these journal entries.</p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>The primary application of design thinking to respond to the problems is the development of this static site in order to record my development process throughout the course. This site has been a nightmare since i started making it. Web design is my least favourite area of IT and causes me constant grief. The original design of this website was created on my desktop and involved a button to swap between different stylesheets, giving this site a ‘dark theme’ option. Due to an issue with my antivirus deleting the area i had it stored in, I started fresh on this terrible design on my laptop and immediately pushed to a private repository to keep a backup.<br>I will use this as a lesson to make regular commits.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>I have spent a large amount of spare time throughout the week completing tasks in various CTF’s including overthewire’s bandit and picoctf as was recommended. The OWASP juice shop was an interesting and fun activity that i really enjoyed working on with the class. I applied techniques that i already knew to solve challenges and learnt new ones that could be applied to the challenge. Over the coming days I will develop writeups for the ctfs and post it on this site.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>For the Wednesday presentation, we researched the CVE-2018-4877 vulnerability in Adobe Flash.<br>Our groups approach to the task was for each member to research the topic individually and compare findings to develop a cohesive presentation. While the research was relatively easy, there was very little documentation on the topic which caused some issues in validating information. During the presentation itself, I was given the task of giving a short introduction to the vulnerability that didnt risk going over the time limit. I was extremely nervous at the time and found myself stumbling over sentences and ultimately gave a poor performance. I have never been comfortable with presenting to strangers but intend to use these sessions to rectify that and develop myself.</p>
<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>In retrospect this first week hasnt gone brilliantly for me as I wasnt prepared for the style and pacing of this class but I believe that I can improve significantly over the next few weeks.<br>I am looking forward to week 2 and the challenges that await with renewed vigor.</p>
