        <p><code>Preword</code></p>
<p>This course was everything I hoped it would be upon starting it. It has enabled me to reach a level of understanding about cyber security that I never thought I would reach. I originally signed up for the summer studio hoping to get a project with a bit of programming or networking. Unfortunately we were assigned to the high speed train project which was aimed more at engineering students than IT students.<br>Thanks to Larry and Darsh, we were able to swap over to the cyber security studio, and that is where this all began.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that more technical info is available in the weekly reflections</p>
<p><code>Begin Report…</code></p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>I started this studio having finished almost all of the cyber security submajor and looking back, I had just about no skills from it. This studio has put me on a path where I can see infosec as a viable career option and how much I still have to learn. The workload of this course was intense and often quite stressful, but in retrospect, the result was worth the effort. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, we were given guidance and presentations by industry professionals who volunteered their time to speak to us. We also were fortunate enough to have a great team leading this course with their own experience and skills on the topic.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/04/Reflection_Posts/Final/larry.jpg" title="larry">
<p><code>picture is bigger than I thought</code></p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>Almost every challenge faced during the summer studio required me to shift my way of thinking in order to address new issues. I would often be faced with something that I had never seen before such as a hidden vulnerability or an overly specific application that I cant seem to use correctly. Google (duck duck go in truth) became my new best friend over the last 4 weeks as every challenge faced required me to find something that was always hidden deep in a singular search result on the 8th page of search results. The solutions were never straight forward or well defined which constantly required more creative thought on my part in order to use them. </p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Potentially the most important part of the course is the development of new skills. I began this studio believing that I had some decent skills in most parts of IT but soon realised that what I knew was just a page in a very large book. The course wasnt a guide on how to get from point A to point B, instead it was assisted research where the students were set goals and expected to learn fast enough to reach them. That being said, we weren’t alone in our efforts and were guided in the right direction by our tutors and given hints and lectures that helped us reach where we are in such a short space of time.</p>
<p>When I started the course the most I could confidently do was a couple of web exploits. Now I am quite confident that I can crack most easy machines and have a fair crack at the medium ones. I still am not quite confident enough to take on the harder machines as I feel like they will strain my sanity.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>The first deliverable that we were given was a group presentation on a security vulnerability just two days after the class began. The allotted time frame was quite stressing as we weren’t prepared to just jump straight in. The stress was relieved by having a group pre-built before entering the subject. The presentation didn’t go too well as we were all quite nervous presenting something we had only just learned in front of a group of strangers. As we realised then, our communication skills needed work too.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we took part in scrums and free for alls where we were put out of our comfort zone and had to talk about how we were going and our progress over the past couple of days. This helped us to get to know the other students in the course and develop our social skills. </p>
<p>We also used microsoft teams for communication and collaboration between tutors and students throughout the course. It served as an effective tool where we could vent any issues or questions to be answered.<br>Teams started out as a serious place reserved for proper questions and soon turned into a more relaxed environment as everyone got to know each other.</p>

<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>I believe that I have achieved more over these last four weeks than I expected when first going in. This studio has been an amazing experience that offers much more value than I would have gotten from the capstone project or the other studios offered. Working with Larry, Darsh, Luke and Jai has been an a pleasure as they have helped me reach goals I never thought I could achieve. Even when issues popped up that hindered my ability to get work complete, they were understanding and helpful. This studio has been a great experience that has given me skills and understanding that I will use well into the future.</p>

        <p>Week 4 in review</p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>This last week has gone by in a bit of a blur. Either its because I was sleep deprived for the majority of it or because it was so enjoyable. Im both exhausted and content with my progress.<br>This last week started with an industry professional leading us through a seminar on reverse engineering. He gave us basic challenges to solve using binary ninja that functioned like a CTF with a flag hidden somewhere in the file. </p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>Throughout the week I was faced with many different challenges that required me to change my way of thinking about challenges. The Hack The Box machines have a lot of rabbitholes that require a lot of time to be sunk in determining whether it is relevant to the challenge or not. Learning new methods of enumeration and different things to be keeping my eyes out for is greatly improving my ability to break through the challenges.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<img src="/2019/03/02/Reflection_Posts/Week-4/root.png" title="root">
<p>Throughout this week I applied myslef to more Hack The Box machines, including access where I reached user (machine was too slow to go for root) and got the root flag from curling. In the coming weeks where the pressure is pretty much gone, I will finish access and go for more machines as I really do love the experience.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/02/Reflection_Posts/Week-4/htb.jpg" title="htb">
<p>Learning the basics of reverse engineering piqued my interest as it was one of the areas I knew the least about going into this. My original thoughts were that it would almost entirely consist of disecting code to reveal secrets or vulnerabilities. But there was a lot more revealed, and it still feels like we were just scratching the surface.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>On Friday, instead of a class we presented our journey and the progress we have made due to the summer studio. For the presentation, we decided to demonstrate the process of solving the piper Deloittes box as well as showing off the potential applications and easy use of the Beef xss framework. The presentation was meant to go all afternoon, but almost nobody showed up to listen. In the end we called it early and went to bar luca to get burgers as a celebration.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/02/Reflection_Posts/Week-4/ferry.jpg" title="ferry">
<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>Now that the course is over I can look back on my highs and lows and judge my performance from them. The final week of the course proved to be the least stressful while allowing me to show my development through the different challenges offered. Compared to where I was in the first week, this one has revealed unbelieveable improvement. Going forward I can’t wait to continue to develop my skills at my own pace without the pressure of deliverables.</p>

        <p>Week 3 in review</p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/chaos.png" title="chaos">
<p>This last week has had its fair share of challenges and problems while at the same time being extremely fun and informative. My personal challenge for this week was to complete a boot2root on a HackTheBox active machine as there are no hints or walkthroughs to help me get through them. The machine i went with was the HTB Chaos machine as it had been recommended to me by David who had beaten it just before. The challenge had its share of traps and rabbitholes and it seems I went down every one (details coming in the writeup).</p>
<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/root.png" title="root">
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>The Chaos box required me to learn new ways to approach CTF challenges. Previous CTF’s left me searching for something obvious that stood out like a sore thumb (details left out due to HTB policies). Enumeration was both a blessing and a curse as the box would hide the next step quite deep but if you didnt find it you can spend hours searching like I did. The box also demanded that I develop new skills to move through it, for example I had to learn IMAP terminal commands (almost no information on the web), priv escalation of shells, moving from a docker reverse shell to a restricted bash shell and on to a full shell. </p>
<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/email.png" title="email">
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Both the piper box which I managed to get user but not root in, and the chaos box that I barely managed to scrape through, were interesting tasks that provoked a new approach to these challenges. Through them I have developed a better sense for enumeration, google-fu skills and forcing myself to go forward even though I was ready to give up. I have learned how to get reverse shells and use priv esc to get more control on the target as well as improve the shell quality once established. Learning the IMAP terminal commands was an absolute pain as the only information easily available is found on a single unrelated page deep in the documentation.</p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<img src="/2019/02/24/Reflection_Posts/Week-3/beef.png" title="beef">
<p>One of the deliverables due this week was a presentation on an infosec tool of our choice. For the presentation, our group selected the swiss army knife program that is Beef. We started looking into Beef on Tuesday night as we had all been busy up until that point. We initially were just looking into how the tool works and how it can be applied but that soon escalated once I began testing out Beef myself. Once I got it working the way it was intended (script embedded on a website to hook visitors), we were amazed by the amount of power that the program had over the hooked browser. </p>

<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>This week really showed me my progress and improvement over what I was going into this course.<br>I have developed a lot more skills and have become much more capable even though I fell like I have only just scratched the surface. Beating the HTB Chaos machine feels like a huge milestone as it is my first full boot2root on a serious challenge; Although only having completed one machine this week is a bit of a letdown as it feels like im falling behind. I hope that going forward I’m able to develop my skills such that I can breeze through challenges like these.</p>

        <p>Week 2 in review</p>
<h2>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h2> 

<p>This week has been a rollercoaster of good and bad experiences. Due to a bit of a family crisis, my schedule and priorities got somewhat messed up. As a result I fell behind in some tasks and got confused with others. Redesigning my site took the biggest hit as I intended to get it up on Friday and wasnt able to get it together enough to deploy again until Sunday. With the coming week I plan to schedule my time and sequence my tasks better to avoid this mixup again.</p>
<h2>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h2>

<p>After being told about Hexo, the utter catastrophe that was my last site was retired and replaced with this. The static site generating tool was incredibly easy to set up, with the only real issue being the choice of theme. Migrating the posts wasnt too much of an issue as I could move the plain text to a new post (which is why the dates on all of my posts are wrong). Modifying the theme to make it more personal and removing the chinese widgets was an interesting experience. I found myself looking through each file and developing an understanding of how the site was assembled by hexo.</p>
<h2>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h2>

<p>Throughout the week, I dedicated myself to learning web vulnerabilities and exploits. I completed several web based CTF’s including many from PicoCTF and all but one of the web challenges from Hack The Box. For some of these challenges I was able to apply my previous knowledge of topics such as sql injection, but more often than not I found myself back opening new tabs to look up something new (had upward of 40 tabs at one point). </p>
<h2>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h2>

<p>On more than one occasion I found myself consulting my team mates to solve a challenge. For the Lernaean HTB challenge, I had tried it before several years prior and got stumped on a certain part of it; However during the Wednesday class, I worked with David on solving the issue and was able to beat it quite quickly. Several days later, I was attempting the HTB IKnowMag1k challenge and had hit another wall. When I challenged David to see if he could beat it he hit the same wall that I did. We got into a voice chat banging our heads against the aforementioned wall until we finally worked it out at 3am. The ordeal was stressful and exhausting but informative and in the end quite fun.</p>
<h2>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h2>

<p>This last week was quite fun as I was able to learn the practical side of cyber security. We were given an informative presentation from Luke and researched bug bounties and ethical hacking. Solving the CTF challenges was quite entertaining and showed me just how much I have yet to learn and the capabilities of web based attacks.</p>

        <p>I took on cartographer right after completing lernaean so I had the same process in my mind.<br>I captured a sample packet, formed a hydra command and set it loose. The trouble with that is that it was the wrong way to solve it and there was no failure flag for hydra to use. So after realising that I was going to get nowhere like that I investigated how the website worked. I found out that the login form was weak to sql injection so I put in an always true statement and was presented a page saying that cartographer was still in construction.<br>From here I noticed that the url had a query after it: ?info=home.<br>Going out on a limb i changed the home to flag and was given the flag i was after.<br></p>

<p>This test taught me how to use the burpsuite and hydra tools.<br>Upon loading the page im faced with a login form without a username field.<br>The challenge was to get past the login screen in order to get the flag.<br>After watching a video tutorial on how to use hydra and burpsuite (on a different ctf), I felt ready to take on Lernaean. </p>
<p>I set up burpsuite to intercept the packets and sent an incorrect password for the sample packet.<br>Then I turned off the interception and set up hydra using the following command:<br>hydra -V -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txst docker.hackthebox.eu http-post-form “/:password=^PASS^:F=Invalid password!” -s 33625</p>

<p>Hydra spat out the password shortly after that: leonardo.<br>Attempting to use it on the login page presents me with a new page stating that I was too slow.<br>I was quite confused at this stage and had to consult the internet for help. A reddit post where<br>someone was stuck on the same part. The internet was helpful without just giving away the answer completely. The suggestions hinted that we should use the repeater function of burpsuite to constantly send the login packet and that is exactly what I did. Shortly after, I get a response with the flag in it.</p>
